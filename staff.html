    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Handling Banned Vehicles Properly</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>If you conduct a stop on a banned vehicle (booster/staff only) here’s what to do:<br>
        1. Wait for them to pull over (If they don’t, look on MDT for username and screenshot/save it somehow).<br>
        2. Go up to them, ask if they know that the vehicle is banned. If they say no, tell them to change. Log a warning in the server using ERM.<br>
        3. If they say yes, ask if they are a booster. If they reply yes, ask for a username. Check Discord, and request a direct message from that user confirming.<br>
        3b. If they say they are staff, check and request a direct message.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">RDM/VDM</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>If you have somebody report RDM/VDM to you, please ask for video proof. If they do not provide, check for witnesses and ask the suspect if this is true. Read below.<br>
        If your investigation proves guilty, read below.<br>
        <strong>1st Offense:</strong> Warning<br>
        <strong>2nd Offense:</strong> Kick (15m ban period)<br>
        <strong>3rd Offense:</strong> Blacklist for 3 days<br>
        <strong>4th Offense:</strong> Blacklist for 7 days<br>
        <strong>5th Offense:</strong> Contact HR (Director/Founder team)</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Staff Killing</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Here at MSR we take staff killing very seriously as it seems incredibly disrespectful to all members. If you are killed by another player, DO NOT HANDLE YOURSELF! Contact another staff member to handle it, preferably not your best friend. They will handle the investigation. If it was purposeful, you MUST contact Internal Affairs to handle it.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">STS Escaping</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>It’s simple. If someone runs from STS do the following:<br>
        • Check for warnings.<br>
        • If no warnings, write one.<br>
        • If warnings, you are to use /tempban for 15 minutes. Every previous note/warning for STS escaping is another 15 minutes.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Blacklisted Roleplays</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>In the case this occurs you need to lockdown the scene, contact 1 other staff member (at least) and start your investigation.<br>
        If it’s the following these are NOT ALLOWED:<br>
        • Hitman<br>
        • Hostage<br>
        • Bank (If staff allows, go ahead)<br>
        • Kidnapping<br>
        • Suicidal Roleplays<br><br>
        These all result in a 1hr temp ban.<br><br>
        If you encounter something not listed on here, please feel free to message IA+. DO NOT MESSAGE BELOW INTERNAL AFFAIRS!</p>
